fastapi>=0.115.2 # Your web framework
uvicorn[standard]>=0.29.0 # ASGI server (standard installs cython-based dependencies for performance)
# Note: Your original uvicorn was 0.34.0. The latest as of May 2025 is around 0.29.0 or 0.30.x.
# Using a slightly older but stable version or just uvicorn>=0.29.0 is fine.
# I've used uvicorn[standard] which is recommended.

# Typer was in your original list, if rag_pipeline.py uses it for CLI arguments, keep it.
# If argparse is sufficient (as it seems to be in the last version of rag_pipeline.py), Typer might not be strictly needed.
# For now, I'm keeping it as it was in your provided list, but it seems to be part of a merged line.
typer>=0.9.0 # For CLI applications (if used, ensure it's a separate line)

# Pydantic (often a dependency of FastAPI, good to have explicit if using its features)
