# RAG using NLP

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable question-answering on PDF documents. It runs locally on a GPU and uses an open-source textbook on ubiquitous computing as a sample dataset.

## Features

- Extracts and preprocesses text from PDFs using NLP tools like spaCy.
- Embeds text chunks using a pre-trained model (`all-mpnet-base-v2`).
- Implements a retrieval system for relevant content.
- Generates answers with a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA GPU (tested on RTX 4090) or equivalent
- Libraries: PyMuPDF, spaCy, sentence-transformers, torch, tqdm, accelerate, bitsandbytes, flash-attn
- See the [Setup](#setup) section for detailed instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirth8205/RAG_using_NLP.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (refer to the [Setup](#setup) section below).
3. Run `RAG_using_NLP.ipynb` to process a PDF and start querying.
4. 3. **Download the Sample PDF** (if not already present):
   - The notebook uses "Ubiquitous-Computing.pdf" as a sample dataset. It will be downloaded automatically when you run the notebook, or you can manually download it from [here](https://pervasivecomputing.se/M7012E_2014/material/Wiley.Ubiquitous.Computing.Smart.Devices.Environments.And.Interactions.May.2009.eBook.pdf).

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tirth8205/RAG_using_NLP.git
   cd RAG_using_NLP
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv rag_env
   source rag_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rag_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install PyTorch with CUDA Support** (for GPU usage):
   - Install `torch` with CUDA support based on your CUDA version. For example, for CUDA 12.1:
     ```bash
     pip install torch>=2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
     ```
   - Check available CUDA versions at [PyTorch's official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). If you don’t have a GPU, install the CPU version:
     ```bash
     pip install torch>=2.1.1
     ```

4. **Install Other Dependencies**:
   - Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install the remaining dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Install spaCy Model**:
   - Download the English model for `spaCy` used in the notebook:
     ```bash
     python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```

6. **Verify Installation**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly by running a Python shell and importing the libraries:
     ```python
     import torch, fitz, tqdm, sentence_transformers, accelerate, bitsandbytes, spacy, pandas, numpy
     print("All dependencies imported successfully!")
     ```

7. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `RAG_using_NLP.ipynb`:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Ensure you select the kernel associated with your virtual environment (`rag_env`).

### Notes

- This project is designed to run on a local NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 4090). If running on CPU, performance may vary.
- An internet connection is required to download the models initially, but the pipeline can run offline afterward.

**Instructions:**
1. Open `README.md` in your editor (e.g., VS Code, nano, or any text editor).
2. Replace the entire content of the file with the above Markdown text.
3. Save the file.

**Explanation of Formatting:**
- **Headings:** Used proper Markdown heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) for hierarchy.
- **Lists:** Used `-` for unordered lists and numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) where appropriate.
- **Code Blocks:** All commands are wrapped in triple backticks (```) with the language specified (e.g., ```bash, ```python) for syntax highlighting on GitHub.
- **Links:** Internal links (e.g., `[Setup](#setup)`) and external links (e.g., PyTorch site) are properly formatted using `[text](url)`.
- **Bold and Italics:** Used `**` for bold (e.g., **Clone the Repository**) and `_` for italics (e.g., _Notes_) where emphasis is needed.
- **Consistency:** Ensured consistent spacing, line breaks, and formatting for readability.

This `README.md` is now properly formatted and ready for your GitHub repository. Let me know once you’ve updated the file, and I’ll provide the next step to push these changes to your GitHub repository! If you need any adjustments, just let me know.
